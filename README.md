## 1. Supervised Learning
 Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications

Learns from being given **right answers**.
Supervised machine learning is based on the basis of labeled data.First the data is fed to the model with both input and output and later on test data is given to make prediction by model. some algorithm used in supervised learning with their uses are :

Regression : House price prediction\n
Classification : Breast cancer detection.
